This directory contains code snippets that can be reused by multiple
scripts.  A brief description of each file follows.

output_format.sh:
Provides basic output formatting functions with levels 'plain', 'msg',
'msg2', 'warning' and 'error'.  The 'msg' amd 'msg2' functions print to
stdout and can be silenced by defining 'QUIET'.  The 'warning' and 'error'
functions print to stderr with the appropriate prefix added to the
message.

human_to_size.sh:
A function to convert human readable sizes (such as "5.3 GiB") to raw byte
equivalents. base10 and base2 suffixes are supported, case sensitively. If
successful, the converted byte value is written to stdout and the function
returns 0. If an error occurs, nothing in written and the function returns 1.
Results may be inaccurate when using a broken implementation of awk, such
as mawk or busybox awk.

size_to_human.sh:
The reverse of human_to_size, this function takes an integer byte size and
prints its in human readable format, with SI prefixes (e.g. MiB, TiB).

term_colors.sh:
Contains some common color settings for output_format.sh.
